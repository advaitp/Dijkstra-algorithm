## Dijsktra Algorithm 
Dependencies Libraries
```
Numpy, OpenCV
```


To run the code.Give input initial and final x and y coordinates 
```
python3 Dijkstra-pathplanning-Advait-Patole.py
```

Output of the program will be the image showing optimal path between intial and final points as well as all the points of backtracked optimal path.
